# Linear-Regression-Ecommerce-Company
The data belongs to an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.

## The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

### I will work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file. It has Customer info, such-as Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
